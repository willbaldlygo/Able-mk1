# Avi Build Documentation

## Overview
Avi is an advanced PDF Research Assistant with Microsoft GraphRAG integration, representing the evolution from earlier versions. This document chronicles the complete build process, GraphRAG integration, and architectural decisions.

## Project Genesis
Built in response to identified issues in Able2:
- Data persistence problems (stale data, inconsistent state)
- File management issues (UUID filenames, missing documents)
- Search limitations (single document bias, poor diversity)
- Terminology confusion (sources vs excerpts)
- Accumulated technical debt

## Architecture Overview

### Service-Based Backend (FastAPI)
Clean separation of concerns with dedicated services:

```
backend/
├── main.py                 # FastAPI application entry point
├── config.py              # Environment configuration with dotenv
├── models.py              # Pydantic data models
└── services/
    ├── storage_service.py  # File and metadata management
    ├── document_service.py # PDF processing with PyMuPDF
    ├── vector_service.py   # ChromaDB + agentic search
    ├── ai_service.py       # Anthropic Claude integration
    └── query_analyzer.py   # Intelligent query analysis
```

### Modern React Frontend
Component-based architecture with hooks:

```
frontend/src/
├── App.js                     # Main application container
├── components/
│   ├── DocumentManager.js     # Upload and document management
│   ├── DocumentList.js        # Document display and deletion
│   ├── FileUpload.js          # Drag-and-drop PDF upload
│   ├── ChatInterface.js       # Fixed-height chat with scrolling
│   └── SourceCard.js          # Source attribution display
├── hooks/
│   └── useDocuments.js        # Document state management
├── services/
│   └── api.js                 # Backend API client
└── styles/
    └── globals.css            # Tailwind CSS styling
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Clean Service Architecture
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one domain
- **Atomic Operations**: File operations are transactional
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive cleanup on failures
- **Readable Filenames**: Sanitized original names instead of UUIDs

### 2. Enhanced Search System
Implemented agentic search to address poor search quality:

#### Query Analysis (`query_analyzer.py`)
- **Intent Classification**: Identifies query type (summary, methodology, results, etc.)
- **Topic Extraction**: Filters stop words, extracts key concepts
- **Strategy Generation**: Creates multiple search approaches per query
- **Content Preferences**: Determines preferred content types

#### Strategic Retrieval (`vector_service.py`)
- **Multi-Strategy Search**: Executes 4 different search approaches
- **Content Quality Scoring**: Boosts substantive content, penalizes references
- **Document Diversity**: Ensures results span multiple documents
- **Relevance Weighting**: Combines semantic similarity with content quality

### 3. Fixed-Height Chat Interface
Solved layout issues through systematic container management:
- **App.js**: Fixed viewport height calculation (`calc(100vh - 9rem)`)
- **ChatInterface.js**: Proper flex layout with `flex-shrink-0` and `flex-1`
- **Auto-scroll**: Smooth scrolling to new messages
- **Contained Scrolling**: Messages scroll within fixed boundaries

### 4. Environment Configuration
Robust configuration management:
- **Python-dotenv**: Automatic `.env` file loading
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for missing API keys
- **Flexible Settings**: Configurable search, AI, and server parameters

## Data Storage Strategy

### Clean Data Management
```
data/
├── sources/               # PDF files with sanitized names
├── vectordb/             # ChromaDB persistent storage
└── metadata.json         # Document metadata and relationships
```

### Atomic Operations
All file operations are transactional:
1. Save file
2. Validate PDF
3. Process document
4. Add to vector database
5. Save metadata
6. **Cleanup on any failure**

## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints
- `GET /health` - System health with detailed status
- `GET /documents` - List all uploaded documents
- `POST /upload` - Atomic PDF upload and processing
- `DELETE /documents/{id}` - Clean document deletion
- `POST /chat` - Enhanced chat with agentic search

### Request/Response Models
Clean Pydantic models for type safety:
- `ChatRequest/ChatResponse`
- `DocumentSummary`
- `SourceInfo`
- `UploadResponse`
- `HealthResponse`

## Search Enhancement Details

### Problem Solved
Able2 search returned only references and experimental details instead of meaningful content.

### Solution: Agentic Search
1. **Query Analysis**: Understand what the user is really asking
2. **Multiple Strategies**: Try different search approaches
3. **Content Scoring**: Prioritize substantive content over references
4. **Smart Diversity**: Balance relevance with document variety

### Content Quality Indicators
**Boosted Content:**
- Methodology sections (method, approach, procedure)
- Results sections (findings, data, analysis)
- Substantive content (100+ words)
- Preferred content types based on query intent

**Penalized Content:**
- Reference sections (bibliography, citations)
- Reference-heavy chunks (>2 reference indicators)
- Short, low-information snippets

## Development Workflow
