## Current Documentation Structure

The project now uses only 3 core documentation files:

1. **README.md** - Main project documentation with multimodal capabilities
2. **CLAUDE.md** - Developer instructions and technical details
3. **AGENT_STATUS.md** - Current multimodal implementation status

## Recovery
