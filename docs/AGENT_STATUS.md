# Agent Status - Multimodal Build

## Agent 1 (Architect) - COMPLETED ✅
- System analysis: DONE
- Ollama/llava setup: DONE
- Configuration structure: DONE
- Integration strategy: DONE

### Integration Points for Agent 3:
- **Document Service** (`backend/services/document_service.py:48-72`): Enhance `process_pdf()` method to extract images alongside text using pdf2image + PyMuPDF
- **AI Service** (`backend/services/ai_service.py`): Add multimodal prompt formatting for llava vision model, handle base64 image encoding
- **Vector Service** (`backend/services/vector_service.py`): Extend chunk metadata to include visual descriptions and image references
- **Main API** (`backend/main.py:188-301`): Enhance `/upload` endpoint to handle image processing, add new `/chat/multimodal` endpoint
- **Storage Service** (`backend/services/storage_service.py`): Add image file management and metadata persistence

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Dual Processing Pipeline**: Text extraction (existing) + Image extraction (new) running in parallel for optimal performance
- **Child/Parent + Visual Chunking**: Extend existing 700/2000 token chunking to include visual descriptions per chunk
- **Async Image Processing**: Use background tasks for llava analysis to prevent blocking document uploads
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Store image locations, descriptions, and file references in existing DocumentChunk model
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to work if llava is unavailable, falling back to text-only processing
- **Model Management**: Leverage existing Ollama integration, llava:7b as additional model option alongside text models

### Technical Specifications:
- **Dependencies Added**: pillow>=10.0.0, pdf2image>=1.16.3 (ollama>=0.3.0 already present)
- **Image Formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG for direct upload; PDF image extraction via pdf2image
- **Storage Strategy**: Images saved to `sources/images/` directory with UUID naming
- **Vector Storage**: Visual descriptions embedded alongside text chunks in ChromaDB
- **Performance Target**: <30s processing for typical PDFs with images

### Ready for Backend Development: YES

## Agent 3 (Backend) - COMPLETED ✅
**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Created `services/multimodal_service.py` for core image processing with llava integration
2. ✅ Created `services/image_extractor.py` for PDF image extraction (pdf2image + PyMuPDF)
3. ✅ Enhanced `document_service.py` with multimodal document processing pipeline
4. ✅ Added multimodal endpoints to `main.py` (/upload/multimodal, /chat/multimodal, /documents/{id}/processing-info, /multimodal/capabilities)
5. ✅ Updated AI service for llava integration with vision capabilities
6. ✅ Added multimodal data models to `models.py`
7. ✅ Updated `requirements.txt` with pillow>=10.0.0, pdf2image>=1.16.3

### Backend Implementation Summary:
- **New Services**: `MultimodalService` (llava integration), `ImageExtractor` (PDF/image processing)
- **Enhanced Services**: Document processing with image extraction, AI service with vision capabilities
- **New API Endpoints**: 4 multimodal endpoints for upload, chat, processing info, and capabilities
- **Data Models**: Complete multimodal model set (ImageInfo, MultimodalChatRequest/Response, etc.)
- **Processing Pipeline**: Dual text+image extraction → llava analysis → enhanced chunking with visual context
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works with or without llava, falls back to text-only processing

### Ready for Frontend Development: YES

## Agent 2 (Frontend) - COMPLETED ✅
**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Enhanced file upload UI to accept images (PNG, JPG, JPEG) with multimodal processing indicators
2. ✅ Added image preview components and multimodal badges in document library
3. ✅ Created visual indicators for multimodal documents with processing status
4. ✅ Enhanced chat interface for multimodal responses with visual context display
5. ✅ Added image thumbnails and visual context modal with full image viewing

### Frontend Implementation Summary:
- **File Upload Enhancement**: Accepts PDFs + images, automatic multimodal processing detection, enhanced upload feedback
- **Multimodal Toggle**: Header toggle button for enabling/disabling multimodal processing with state persistence
- **Document Library**: Visual badges showing multimodal status, image counts, visual descriptions, "View Images" buttons
- **Chat Interface**: Enhanced source display with visual indicators, multimodal processing status in responses
- **Visual Context Modal**: Full image thumbnail gallery with descriptions, click-to-expand functionality
- **UI Integration**: Complete integration with existing Able mk I interface and styling

### Technical Features Implemented:
- **Responsive Design**: All multimodal features integrate seamlessly with existing 60/40 layout
- **Visual Feedback**: Processing indicators, status badges, and contextual information throughout UI
- **Image Handling**: Support for PNG, JPG, JPEG with thumbnail generation and modal viewing
- **State Management**: Multimodal preferences saved to localStorage for persistence
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when multimodal features unavailable
- **API Integration**: Full integration with backend multimodal endpoints

---
**Status**: All agents complete! Able mk I now has full multimodal document understanding capabilities with PDF+image processing, llava vision analysis, and comprehensive frontend integration. Ready for testing and deployment.
